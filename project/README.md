# Final Project: ScheduleMe

Synopsis: https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/project/project.html

### ScheduleMe

ScheduleMe is a calendar app I built utilizing the FullCalendar.js library and served via Flask.
The FullCalendar library allows for event creation through interacting with the Calendar itself via clicks, dragging events, or selecting multiple dates. I wanted to take advantage of this by connecting the events to a database and saving events to specific users to create a more functional app. 

Note that the information you register your account with should not be the same credentials you use on other websites/services! Account credentials delivered via HTTP requests are not secure. 

In the future, I would like to continue working improving the project for my own interests; to further my skills and make something even better!
